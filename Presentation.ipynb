The production budget should be kept near typical industry values (23-46 million USD), erring on the low end to maximize ROI, and runtime should be allowed to extend somewhat away fom the mean of 104 minutes if warranted.  Choosing the director is safest from the provided list, and casting directors are encouraged to start searching from the provided list of performers."
